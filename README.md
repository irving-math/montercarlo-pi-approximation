# Pi approximations

In this repo you will find some simple methods to approximate the value of Pi

### Montecarlo
For me, the simplest method to approximate Pi using probabilities. This method is explained on the next 
[blog](https://ndimensions.hashnode.dev/how-to-calculate-pi-in-python) and [here](montecarlo_approximation.ipynb) a 
jupyter notebook with the code.

### Archimedes method by polygons

This approximation is very simple, the only theory that you know is the Pythagoras theorem,
[here](archimedes_aproximation.ipynb) the jupyter notebook
with the code.
